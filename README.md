# FindAGraveData
Take a bunch of data from findagrave.com and copy it, run the program and the output is people born before X year split into age groups.
This was used for a project in AP Environmental Science where we examined death year and survivorship graphs between eras
I used the URL https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/641307/memorial-search?page=1 and scrolled through 104 pages of data pressed
Ctrl A and Ctrl C then profit 

Made in 2019 for a my AP Environmental Class. Made mostly for fun. Once I was finished I handed Mrs.Garr an exe for the file
to hopefully use in years coming
